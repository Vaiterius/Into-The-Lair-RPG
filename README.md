# Into The Lair
*v1.2*

### About
A text-based, dungeon RPG played solely off the Python console.

Features rooms to navigate to and from, an inventory system for gear and items, combat encounters with enemies, dialogue with NPC(s), a leveling system, and... easter eggs? Made to feel like demo for a much larger game, that I probably won't make. Can modify with the config files if you want to mess around.

Some nice [ambience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wScEFaoqwPM&ab_channel=SwordCoastSoundscapes) to accompany the game.

### Playing
1. Click the green "Code" button to download
2. Run the .exe application
3. Play the game!

This has been the first real project that I've made so far. For fun.

This is meant to be more focused on story than gameplay, but let me know of any bugs, crashes, or suggestions! :D
